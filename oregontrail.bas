Missouri to Oregon City, Oregon in
1847. Your family of five will cover the
2040-mile Oregon Trail in 5-6 months

INTRODUCTION

"The Santa Fe Trail being first
established, a signboard was later
set up to show where the Oregon
Trail branched off.
It bore the
simple legend 'Road To Oregon.'
. Surely so unostentatious a sign

The American Fur Trade of
the Far West

During the thirty-year period from 1840
to 1 870, thousands of pioneers traveled
over the 2000-mile Oregon Trail tc
settle on the West Coast. The history of
the trail may be seen by some as a
strong example of heroic American
themes such as "conquering the fron-
tier" and "the pioneer spirit." To others,
the great western migration carries the
political overtones of the colonists and
their descendents forcing out British
imperialism and clearing away the
native American Indians in an effort to
dominate middle North America them-
selves. At the very least, the journey
over the trail represents the human
of many individuals who,
stories
oblivious to historical trends, tried to
survive in life as best they knew how.

FOR

COMPUTER

RATIONALE
USAGE
This computer simulation, developed
initially in 1971 and refined in 1975, is
an attempt to give students a better
feeling of what the journey west was
like for the people who attempted it.
Like all simulations, OREGON does
not attempt to replicate exactly a trip
on a wagon train in the 1840's. But it
does attempt to present students with
some of the resources, decisions, and
events that faced the pioneers of that
day. Although students can find out
about the Oregon Trail by reading
books, visiting museums, watching
movies, and similar
the
simulation allows them to learn from
actively participating in the simulated
experiences of people from another
era.

Background On The OREGON Program
In 1971, Don Rawitsch and Bill Heinemann were
participating together in a practice teaching
College,
program
Northfield, Minnesota. Don was teaching a class
on the history of the American West and provided
the preliminary information which Bill, a math
teacher, used to construct the OREGON program.
The program was first implemented on the
Minneapolis Schools timesharing system. On the
completion of the practice teaching program, the
program was removed from the Minneapolis sys-
tem and remained only as a curled up listing until
Don joined the MECC staff in 1974 and loaded it
onto the MECC system. Don then proceeded to do
further research on the Oregon Trail and modi-
fied the program for historical accuracy to pro-
duce the present version. The program has been
implemented on Hewlett-Packard, UNIVAC, and
Control Data systems.

Background on MECC
The Minnesota Educational Computing Con-
sortium (MECC) was created in 1972 out of con-
cern by the governor and legislature that educa-
tional computing needed a central source of
coordination for planning, and a mechanism to
insure that all educational institutions in the state
would have equal opportunity of access to
computing services for both instructional and
Consortium's
administrative
membership includes the University of Minnesota
(5 campuses), The Minnesota State University
System (7 campuses), the Minnesota Community
College System (18 campuses), the Minnesota
Department of Education (representing the state's
436
districts), and the
Minnesota
Administration.
of
Minnesota is the only state in the country having a
central organization for coordinating educational
computing activities across all levels of education.
The MECC Instructional Services Division offers a
variety of services to consortium members. A
technical staff operates the largest of Minnesota's
computers dedicated to instructional computing,
a Control Data CYBER 73 time-sharing system.
The MECC Timeshare System is currently con-
figured for 375 user ports and serves about 1100
in schools and
interactive terminals located
colleges across the state. A large multiplexing
communications network provides the route by
which MECC users access the Timeshare System,
whether
the
Minneapolis-St. Paul computer center or hun-
dreds of miles away near the Canadian border.
The MECC User Services staff of instructional
coordinators helps user learn to make better use of
the computer by visiting school and college sites,
conducting workshops, providing over-the-phone
consulting service, publishing news letters, and
producing written documentation for programs in
the MECC Timeshare System's central library.
