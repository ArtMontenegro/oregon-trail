Oregon Trail
============

The original Oregon Trail.

Bio
---

The original was released in 1971 and meant to teach children
about the realities of settlers crossing the Oregon Trail.
It was written with HP time-shared BASIC running on an HP 2100
microcomputer. It was produced by the MECC
([Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium)](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/09/the-true-story-of-real-life-oregon-trail/380730)
which was state-funded with specific goals to develop educational
software for children.

In 1978 one of the authors re-released the source code in BASIC 3.1
in a Creative Computing issue. The MECC started to encourage use of the
Apple II computer. The game was adapted and in 1980 a version with
minimalistic graphics was released. This became very popular with the
general community and improved graphics were released in 1985.

It is considered one of the most classic games of a generation.
Estimates of 65 - 75 million copies of the game were sold to date.

It holds a special place in many American students' hearts.
The game was frequently seen in elementary school class rooms in the
1990s and early 2000s. It often came bundled with computers at the
time.

In 2011 the code was
[re-released again](http://www.filfre.net/misc/oregon1978.bas)
in BASIC.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_\(series\))
has a fairly good timeline on the progression of the series.
